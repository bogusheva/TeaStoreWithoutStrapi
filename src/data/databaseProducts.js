That was my first loose leaf tea, and upon purchasing it again a couple of days ago, I can still unequivocally say that this is not only the best Black tea, but the best tea an individual can purchase.  The flavor of the tea itself is amazing, and it also plays host to honey sweetness and leather. I drink this tea iced and hot, and its versatility is another factor at play that keeps me coming back for more (and I buy the 1 lb. bags).  All in all, get this tea and prepare to be spoiled.",
