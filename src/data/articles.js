        title: "Organic Tea",
        text: [
          "Many people in today’s society (especially in Los Angeles) make a conscious effort to purchase organic produce and groceries. However, some may overlook the importance of buying organic tea as well. Organic tea is not only easier to find than you might think, but it also has a variety of benefits as well.",
          "Tea is considered organic if a third-party certification company, such as CCOF or QAI, certifies it. This means that all the ingredients used, and the entire process the tea goes through are approved: from the growing to the blending, to the packaging. During the growing process, organic tea leaves are not treated with any chemical pesticides (however, minimal, all-natural pesticides may be used). The caffeine and antioxidants produced by the tea leaves serve as natural pest prevention. By eliminating the use of harmful chemicals on the tea leaves, organic tea also keeps the surrounding environment and habitat cleaner and more sustainable.",
          "Once the organic tea leaves are harvested, they are taken through a separate and rigorous process and cleaning procedure to ensure no cross-contamination with non-organic tea. When you purchase organic tea, it has been treated with the utmost care to follow the highest quality of organic standards.",
          "Creating a great quality tea that is also organic takes lots of time, testing, and cultivation of relationships with the tea farmers and suppliers. Finding a quality tea partner takes time and many cuppings, which according to our founder, Steve, is all part of the fun. Knowledge of harvest times and seasonal ingredients is also ideal to ensure maximum freshness. Here at Art of Tea headquarters, hundreds of organic teas are taste-tested regularly. This guarantees that we provide the highest quality, best tasting organic tea.",

        title: "Dessert Tea vs Sweets",
        text: [
          "Everyone needs a boost of sugar from time to time, but we're well aware of the consequences of overindulgence. Giving in to sugar cravings too frequently can impact your mind and body, causing irritability or fatigue. It's important to be mindful of the sugar you consume, which is why Art of Tea has an entire selection of organic, delectable dessert teas to choose from. Instead of overloading on sugars and carbs, experiment with these dessert teas to satisfy your sweet tooth.",
          "Velvet Tisane is a rich alternative to average sugary foods. A combination of rooibos, sweet ground chocolate, and organic mint provides a succulent treat with a smooth vanilla finish. Like diving into a traditional scarlet cake, this velvety tea melts on your tongue and provides the same cherry notes and warming effects you know so well. With a very low caffeine content, you won't suffer the same hyperactive symptoms as a sugar high. Instead, the ground chocolate will provide gentle alertness and calming contentment.",
          "The Vanilla Berry Truffle Tisane is an excellent choice to substitute the taste of light and crispy truffle. The tart berry married with vanilla notes gives the tea a soft and enticing taste, which is finally glazed over with fresh cream. Best of all, this truffle tea is entirely caffeine-free, so it can be divulged in at any time of day.",
          "A perfect alternative to springtime dessert, the Lemon Meringue Tea will keep you from reaching for the silverware. This bright, lemony beverage captures everything from the lovely texture of authentic pie to the aromatic finish of it. Orange peels, rose petals, and green rooibos blended artfully into one savory tea makes for a coup de grace when the sugar cravings threaten you with defeat.",
          "Rounding out the finish is one of Art of Tea's most popular samples, the Caramelized Pear Dessert Tisane. Enriched with honey, organic apples, and marigolds, this fruity tea takes the cake for a treat that will satisfy the senses. Not too rich and not too subtle, this tea replicates a flavor that is difficult to imitate, but delicious when it's done well. Finally, this Pear tea is caffeine-free as well, meaning it can be brewed at the finality of lunch or the beginning of bedtime.",
          "Curbing your sugar intake can be trying. We've all crumbled under the pressure of cakes, cookies, and chocolate. The siren song of an ice cream float can entice even the strongest of us. However, taking a sabbatical from sugar can be so deeply rewarding. Cutting out sugar can increase your mood, decrease bloating and fatigue, and break the cycle of dependency on sweets. Natural alternatives such as a warming cup of dessert tea can make all the difference in providing the flavor and rich decadence of the real thing while saving your body and mind from the consequences of sugary carbs. Venture out into the realm of organic, fair-trade certified tea to champion the battle of sugar needs and indulge in an entirely new way.",

        title: "The Benefits of Oolong Tea",
        text: [
          "Oolong tea, like many other ayurvedic teas, can provide a plethora of benefits for the body and mind when consumed on a daily basis. Originating from the same shrub as black teas and green teas - the Camellia Sinensis shrub - oolong tea falls into its own unique category of tea with the way its leaves are carefully cultivated, oxidized, and processed. Here at Art of Tea, our tea masters want all of you oolong lovers out there to understand how this wonderful cup of tea is created, and the benefits it can have on your overall well-being in the long-term.",
          "As mentioned before, oolong tea leaves come from the Camellia Sinensis plant, a species of evergreen shrub that contributes to the creation of many different teas. Oolong tea goes through a unique semi-oxidation process that ranges from 1% - 99%, differing from the stark oxidation process of green tea or black tea. Shortly after picking, oolong leaves are withered and semi-oxidized in the sun and then shade dried. Afterward, they are basket-tossed to break down the cells on the surface of the leaves and then wok-fired, halting the oxidation process.",
          "Oolong teas are often processed over charcoal or wood, giving them a unique flavor with various finishing styles. Finally, the oolong leaves are curled or rolled into crispy shapes that resemble tiny black dragons (Oolong (Wu-lung) tea originates from China and is actually transliterated from two words meaning “black” and “dragon” in English). Because oolong tea leaves are more mature, they are harvested later in the spring than green or white teas – usually from late April to early May.",
          "Over time, drinking oolong tea can have mild benefits and positive side effects on your body. While we don't promise any of the below we thought we would list out bits of information that studies have shown:",
          "Provides Antioxidant Properties - The polyphenol properties of oolong tea are also known to remove free radicals, making it a great antioxidant. Studies have shown that a daily dose of oolong can remove free radicals and slightly decrease the chances of contracting diseases such as cancer, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and diabetes.",
          "Promotes Healthy Teeth and Bones - The antioxidant properties of oolong have been shown to help to protect against tooth decay, prevent osteoporosis, and strengthen the bones in the body. Studies have shown that people how regularly drink oolong or black tea have been shown to lose bone mineral density (BMD) at a slower rate than non-tea drinkers.",
          "Promotes Healthy Skin - The antioxidant properties of oolong tea have been shown to combat outbreaks of eczema.",
          "Improves Mental Clarity - Oolong tea contains caffeine, which is well known to give a temporary boost of alertness.",
          "Aids With Digestion - Oolong tea has been shown to reduce inflammation in the digestive tract, making it highly beneficial to anyone with acid reflux or ulcer issues. Additionally, this tea has been known to combat some of the bad bacteria in the stomach.",

        title: "Which Teas Have the Most Antioxidants?",
        text: [
          "Customers looking to have the best possible health outcomes from their food and beverage choices are quick to pick up on the benefits of regularly drinking teas. Not only does tea provide you with important antioxidants like tannins and catechins, but its varieties also offer you the opportunity to take in even more antioxidants and nutrients depending on the blend, the other herbs used to create its unique flavor, and the way the tea is harvested and prepared.",
          "The trust is, there is no “best” tea for antioxidant absorption. The different classes of teas have different antioxidants that help the body in different ways, it’s true. All of them are rich in these compounds, though, so all of them are beneficial. Like with many nutrients and minerals, antioxidants are most effective when they are consumed consistently, in moderate amounts that reflect a human’s ideal diet.",
          "What does this mean for your tea choices? It means that your best bet is to simply focus on drinking two to three cups a day of your favorite blends for different moods and occasions. Since the different types of tea do have different antioxidants, switching things up will make sure you get the full range of available nutrients from this important food source.",
          "If you’re trying to build a wide selection of teas to keep your taste buds interested in your new healthy beverage option, look no further than Art of Tea. Our selection includes a number of great flavors for each major type of tea.",
          "Black teas like English Breakfast, Golden Monkey, and Monk’s Blend",
          "Green teas like Liquid Jade, Green Pomegranate Tea, and Matchasticks",
          "White teas that include Tuscany, Silver Needle, and White Coconut Crème",
          "Oolong teas like Iron Goddess of Mercy, 12:00 PM Tea, and Crimson Oolong",
          "These great tea flavors provide you with the chance to experience tea the way it is blended in various places around the world, opening up your senses and allowing you to experience the fresh, distinct, and nuanced flavors at home.",

        title: "Does Tea Hydrate You?",
        text: [
          "At The Teath Avenue, we have a deep love and appreciation for all things tea – and some of our iced teas have won awards at international tea competitions. But sometimes, our customers ask us: does tea 'count' as water? Does tea help you hydrate? In the past, some have argued that tea actually doesn't have a net-hydrating impact on the body. As your source for all things tea, we wanted to answer this question once and for all.",
          "Is tea hydrating? In a word: yes. Both iced and hot tea hydrate you and help deliver water to the body. So why all the confusion? It all starts with caffeine.",
          "All tea blends except herbal or caffeine-free tea contain some form of caffeine. Whether white tea, green tea, or black tea, tea leaves contain a small amount of caffeine. They don't contain nearly as much as coffee, but it's still significant: a cup of coffee has about 100 mg of caffeine, while a cup of tea has roughly 30 or 40.",
          "Caffeine is a diuretic: a substance that causes the body to urinate. For a time, some believed that the diuretic effect of the caffeine in tea offset the hydration – in short, that drinking tea caused you to urinate more water than you absorbed into the body.",
          "Thankfully, though, this isn't the case. Tea is a low-caffeine drink, so the diuretic effect is minimal. On the whole, tea gives your body much more water than it causes your body to lose. So drinking hot tea or iced tea helps to hydrate your body overall.",
          "That said, caffeinated teas aren't for everyone. Some people experience insomnia, headaches, or even drowsiness from consuming caffeine. Ultimately, it's all about listening to your body to see if you react well to caffeinated or caffeine-free teas.",

        title: "Is Your Water Quality Hurting Your Tea?",
        text: [
          "What does it take to make a perfect cup of tea? Aside from the obvious ingredient (high-quality tea!), we typically focus on an often overlooked, yet crucial, part of the tea experience — the water!",
          "Water is one of the quick-fixes to your common iced tea problems, and it could be the key component to making all of your teas and tea-based beverages even better! ",
          "The average cup of hot tea or glass of iced tea (without ice) contains, on average, only 1% tea solids and 99%+ water. If your water quality is poor, it can leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, and nobody wants that. Here's how you can make sure your water quality is right up there with The Teath Avenue's tea quality.",
          "1. Collect water from where you get water for your tea. If you use tap water, check that tap. If you like to filter your water, test the filtered water. You want to test the quality of the water that will become tea! The time between collection and testing can have an impact on the results, so it is important to take the sample and test the water immediately. For example, chlorine can evaporate relatively quickly.",
          "2. The first test is simple. The water should be sniffed, tasted, and visually examined. This process will allow you to observe characteristics like saltiness, bitterness, metallic taste, or chalkiness.",
          "3. A wide variety of testing options are available. The Aquacheck HACH 5-in-1 testing kit is a useful tool in assessing which water quality issues may need to be addressed. Key elements to test include: Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Hardness, Chlorine, Total Alkalinity, pH",
          "If you have no filtration system in place, or if yours is outdated, now is the time to make a change! If your tap water just isn't doing the trick, consider investing in a simple water filtration system, whether it be a filtering pitcher or an attachment to your tap! One thing to note, however, is that softened water tends to distort tea flavors. If your home is using a hard water softener, consider getting your tea water from a different source!",
          "Time spent assessing and improving your water quality is worth the effort as it makes an enormous impact on the taste of your tea. If you're fortunate enough to have clean water to make tea, you should make the most of it and ensure that the water quality is the best it can be. ",

        title: "What Does 'Hand-Blended' Tea Even Mean?",
        text: [
          "If you're used to the instant gratification of going to a grocery store, spotting a tea that looks appealing on the shelf, and throwing it in your cart, it might be frustrating having to wait for your order to arrive. You've probably even wondered why we tack on those extra few days before we ship. Well, we're so glad you asked! (And if you didn't ask, just play along for the sake of this post!)",
          "Every order is hand-blended and hand-packed at our headquarters in sunny Los Angeles. But what does that even mean? It means that you won't find conveyor belts or mass-producing machinery in our warehouse. Instead, you'll find our production team carefully mixing each tea blend, painstakingly going through a quality assurance process, and packing and weighing every bag of tea.",
          "Obviously, it'd be a lot easier to just use machines. We'd probably produce significantly more tea if we did! However, we've chosen to do things by hand because we believe in artistry and intention of tea. There are a couple of benefits to hand-blending tea, too!",
          "When you hand-blend, you're also being gentler to the leaves. We use whole leaves of tea of a higher tea grade, so it's important to us that we don't crush our leaves in an industrial blender. Hand-blending allows for smaller batches, too. We can make small batches of tea to order to ensure freshness and if we mess up and add the wrong ingredient, we only have to throw out a little bit of tea! (We're just teasing on that last part, but blending small batches does allow for optimum freshness!)",
          "Hand-blending and packing take some time. We hustle as hard as we can, but that's why we don't ship a box of tea to you as soon as you order it. If we did, that would mean that the tea you ordered was already sitting on a shelf in a warehouse collecting dust. And we don't think you'd want that. Or maybe you would? To each their own. ",
          "Next time you order from The Teath Avenue, rest easy knowing one of our tea'm members is scooping out fresh tea into a hand-labeled bag just for you. We hope knowing how much love we put into your order makes it taste that much better!",

        title: "Roses vs. Rosehips: What's the Difference?",
        text: [
          "Our ingredients should look familiar. All of our blends are made with plants most people have heard of: peppermint, spearmint, chamomile, and hibiscus to name a few. We seldom dive deeper into what these ingredients are and why we add them to our blends. Some ingredients are there strictly for flavor or aesthetics. Others contribute to supposed health benefits, too. (We can't promise that drinking our tea will make you immortal, but many of the botanical ingredients we used are believed to have health benefits.) Some are added for all of the reasons above! Let's dive a little bit deeper into two ingredients: Roses and Rosehips.",
          "Rose petals and rosehips are two ingredients we use frequently.  Don't let their names fool you, though. Roses and rosehips aren't both flowers. In fact, rosehips are actually the seed pod from the rose plant! This seed pod is fruit-like and even resembles a crabapple. Rosehips are often pruned from rose bushes, which is why you don't see them often.",
          "We don't use rosehips too often. However, when we do, we do so for their nutritional value. They're slightly tart and like many other fruits, contain a good bit of Vitamin C. This tartness goes well with green tea, which makes our Green Pomegranate blend such a tangy treat.",
          "Roses, on the other hand, don't contribute vitamins, but instead, give a unique taste and aroma. Rose petals are often used in our blends to add a delicate, floral flavor. Want to try a tea where roses are the star? Try Tuscany or For Her. Both are whimsically rosy with floral notes that don't overpower the other ingredients.",
          "Both roses and rosehips contribute two more things that we love in a good tea blend: Aesthetics and a flavor buffer. We often want our teas to look as beautiful as they taste and smell. That's one of the major reasons we add beautiful botanical ingredients to our blends. We also like to add flowers to help tone down other powerful ingredients. A cup of just hibiscus would be brutally sour. But a cup of hibiscus and rose hips has just the right balance.",
          "Try these ingredients for yourself and see how they differ in taste, smell, and purpose.",

          "As a fan of The Tea-th Avenue, I have always enjoyed the taste of green tea, both warm in the morning and evening, and iced during the day. I began drinking 8 to 10 cups a day after New Years', 2007 when I had resolved myself to promoting better health practices for me and my family.",
          "I increased my green tea intake as a result of an article I had read that linked green tea consumption to a boost in weight loss and I figured it couldn’t hurt to try it, especially since I like green tea anyway and normally drink a lot of it. My children enjoy the taste of iced tea, and so increasing their intake was simple. I knew that there were other health benefits from drinking green tea, and had heard about its antioxidant properties, but I wasn’t aware of all of the amazing ways that it increases health until I started doing some research.",
          "I learned that white tea, green tea, oolong tea, and black tea all come from the leaves of the same plant, the Camellia sinensis. Green tea is often baked or steamed immediately after harvesting, Oolong tea is from partially oxidized leaves, and black tea is fully oxidized and cooked. I also learned that the majority of green tea is grown in Japan and China and from what I have experienced so far there is a difference between the two country’s teas. When processed, high-quality Chinese Green Tea is generally pan-fried while Japanese Green Tea is quickly deep steamed, giving them very different tastes and qualities. Chinese green tea is most often brewed by placing the leaves in my favorite teapot, mesh bag or just letting them float in a cup and placing it into freshly drawn hot water. We also explored matcha Japanese green tea, the leaves are most often ground into a powder and whisked with a small amount of hot water.",
          "Green tea achieves superfood status because of its polyphenols. Polyphenols are stronger antioxidants than vitamin C. Antioxidants travel through the body and clean up free radicals, which are charged particles that damage cells and DNA. These free radicals are a result of normal metabolism but are also accrued from environmental toxins, like ultraviolet rays from the sun, air pollution, radiation, and cigarette smoke. Polyphenols in green tea have been found to reduce the occurrence of diseases caused by free radicals, including heart disease and cancer, and to reverse the aging process.",
          "Green tea has been found to assist diabetics by helping to regulate glucose in the bloodstream and stimulate the proper function of the pancreas. The pancreas is responsible for releasing the hormone, insulin, which is underproduced in diabetes. Green tea has also been found to assist in the treatment of arteriosclerosis by helping to flush plaque attached to veinous walls.",
          "This information was enough to make me feel great about drinking green tea. Then yesterday, I read an article about the results of some research conducted in Egypt from the University of Alexandria where they tested green tea in combination with antibiotics against 28 disease-causing microbes. In every case, they found that the green tea decreased the drug resistance of the microbes and increased the drug’s effectiveness. They found that this was true for even antibiotic-resistant microbes.",
          "According to this research, longevity is greater in countries where green tea is regularly consumed, yet we are only now considering that the consumption of tea may be one of the explanations. As my family and I enjoy the light, fresh flavor of our new favorite beverage, it makes me feel good to know that we are also taking care of our health.",

          "We're sure you've seen the increase in interest around matcha recently, and for good reason! Matcha is not only delicious, it's also filled with health benefits! Today we're doing a little introduction to matcha to answer a few of your questions and give tips on preparation!",
          "Contrary to the popular belief that matcha derives from Japan, it originally emerged during the Song Dynasty in China. Matcha is made from a shade-grown green tea, also known as Gyokuro that is carefully steamed and meticulously dried. After the steaming process, the leaves are separated from the stems and the leaves alone, called tencha, are grounded into a powder called matcha. The art of producing, preparing, and consuming this powdered tea became a ritual performed by Zen Buddhists in China. In 1191, a Zen monk by the name of Eisai, traveled to Japan and introduced matcha to the country. As matcha’s popularity lessened in China, the Japanese embraced this powdered tea. Matcha eventually became an important part of rituals in Zen monasteries in Japan.",
          "At The Teath Avenue, we offer two types of matcha–ceremonial and culinary. Ceremonial Matcha is primarily from Japan. It is typically stone grounded into a fine powder producing a brighter green hue. The powder is whisked back and forth rapidly to create frothiness when preparing. Ceremonial Matcha has a grassy taste with a sweet undertone. Grade A Matcha, on the other hand, is the matcha used in cooking and is added in lattes and iced teas.",
          "The preparation process for matcha depends on what you are creating. A few of our favorite ways to prepare matcha include traditional matcha preparation, our Art of Iced Matcha, and baking with matcha (like a Matcha Pound Cake)!",
          "For traditional matcha preparation, follow these steps using a matcha bowl, whisk, and scoop:",
          "1. Preheat the tea bowl with boiling water and moisten the tea whisk.",
          "2. Scoop 2 grams (1/4 teaspoon per 6-8oz of water) of matcha green tea and add approximately one teacup of hot water.",
          "3. Hold the bowl firmly with one hand and whisk from left to right to form frothy bubbles. Whisk the Matcha well and break up any small lumps with the tip of your whisk. This assures the most optimal flavor and a smooth and creamy texture.",
          "4. Hold the whisk in the middle of your foam, and allow the liquid inside the whisk to draw off, then gently remove.",
          "That's it! You'll have a delicious cup of matcha ready to enjoy!",

        text: [
          "When enjoying a delicious cup of steaming Earl Grey, does one ever wonder how such a delightful beverage got its distinct name? Most teas are named after their color, content, or place of origin, yet Earl Grey stands alone, for its name does not describe color, content, or place of origin. What’s more, Earl Grey denotes British roots, yet tea itself is a product of such exotic locales as India, Sri Lanka, and China. So what is the story?",
          "It turns out that Earl Grey tea is named after the second Earl Grey, Charles Grey, who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1834.  But how did a Prime Minister of England become associated with the exotic product that is tea? Yes, tea is a staple of English life, yet everyone knows that tea is a Far-East affair. Did he perhaps consume so much of it that it was only natural to name it after him? Such as what happened with the Earl of Sandwich? We all know how that turned out. According to the legend that was not the case at all, but in fact, something even more dramatic…but questionable.",
          "The story goes that this particular tea blend containing the oils from the rind of a bergamot orange was a gift to the Prime Minister after one of his men saved the son of a Chinese mandarin from drowning. Although this sounds well and good, the fact of the matter is that this story is shot with holes. First off, at the time China was a country of green tea. Even though Earl Grey can be made from a white, green, or oolong tea, history shows that black tea, was not as popular, and therefore probably would not have been even offered as a gift for visitors. Another discrepancy is the mere fact that Earl Grey never was in China at any point in his life. Some attribute the voyage from afar as the etrog's ceremonial presence at the Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot around the world.",
          "Despite these legends, more research suggests that the Jacksons of Piccadilly received the recipe from Lord Grey and that it was derived from China tea from its introduction. ",

          "Earl Grey tea is the most popular flavored tea throughout the world. The flavor of bergamot fruit is added to just about any style of tea, though most popular on a black tea base. Bergamot (Citrus bergamia) is a sort of sour orange. This citrus fruit is most likely a hybrid of Citrus limetta (sweet lime/sweet lemon) and Citrus aurantium (bitter orange). Commercially, bergamot is grown in southern Italy, in Calabria, where more than 80% of this fruit is cultivated.",
          "The simple combination of bergamot and tea has been at the center of many stories, disagreements, and legends, as to its origin. The one common thread throughout all the stories is that it is somehow related to the British Prime Minister from 1830–1834, Earl Grey. One story goes that, while on a mission to China, Earl Grey saved the life of a mandarin nobleman and was given the recipe as a symbol of gratitude. Another origin story says Earl Grey was given this tea as a gift at the end of a successful diplomatic visit to China. Some argue Lord Grey’s men saved a mandarin’s son from drowning and he was presented with this flavored tea in gratitude.",
          "This tea might have also been developed to imitate the more expensive types of teas from China, like Keemun teas, and served by the Grey family. Or, Lord Grey developed the recipe for this flavored tea himself and gave it to a local tea house in London to produce. Some say Earl Grey was presented this tea by an envoy on his return trip from China. Others say that on the way home with its load, a trading ship was hit by a horrible storm. The tea and bergamot fruit mixed together and the tea was ruined. But, Lady Grey liked the flavor and served this unique exotic tea while hosting. Or, the tea was flavored specifically for Lord Grey by a mandarin to suit the local water of Northumberland to offset the taste of lime (calcium) in the local water.",

          "Understanding the “Art of Tea” in its entirety is an age-old question that we are still continuously exploring today. With brand new tea knowledge and discoveries unveiling themselves each day, the journey into the world of tea is an exciting and limitless adventure with room for us all to explore, connect and interact.",
          "Iron Goddess of Mercy (Ti Kuan Yin) is a premium oolong from China originating in the 19th century. Ti Kuan Yin production is a very complex hand-crafted tea that is produced twice a year (spring and winter). Legend tells of a pious, poor farmer Wei, who would pass a rundown temple which housed the statue of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. Being poor he couldn’t do much, but one day he brought a broom to clean up. Twice a month for several months he did this until one night Guanyin appeared in his dreams. She told him of a gift she had left for him behind the temple that he should share with others. There he found a small tea plant which he planted in a nearby field. The tea plant flourished and cuttings were used to plant more tea bushes. The area prospered with the selling of this fine tea and the temple was restored and became the beacon of the region.",
          "Genmaicha, or brown rice tea, is a Japanese green tea blended with roasted brown rice. This tea is sometimes referred to as popcorn tea due to the grains of toasted brown rice popping during roasting, resembling popcorn. But there is typically no popcorn in this tea. A variation on this tea adds matcha to the blend. The history of this tea is the stuff of legends. ",
          "In 15th century Japan, a samurai was planning a military campaign. His servant, Genmai, was serving him green tea, a luxury in that time, and a few kernels of rice fell out of his sleeve into the samurai’s cup. In a fit of anger, the samurai drew his katana and beheaded the servant. As the samurai drank his tea he realized the rice added to the flavor of the tea and became remorseful. He ordered that this new tea shall be served to commemorate his late servant. To honor his memory, he named the tea Genmai-cha. Another story puts the origin of Gen Mai Cha at about 100 years ago when a small tea shop in Kyoto created a more affordable tea for the people using a late harvest bancha tea blended with rice to mask the tea’s flavor.",
          "These are just a few of the many stories told over the years about Tea. It is incredible that modern consumers can still buy and drink such a historically rich beverage.",

          "It's no secret that we source many of our teas from Japan. After all, Japan is one of the largest tea producers in the world. Japanese tea even has its own distinct characteristics. Despite all of this, there's still a demand for Art of Tea in Japan. Why is it that a country that produces some of the best tea looks to an American tea brand to source teas?",
          "Japan is undoubtedly a tea-loving country. However, much of the available tea is a single origin. Art of Tea is a little different. Our specialty is in blending, so our teas combine ingredients to create exciting and creative new flavors that you can't find anywhere else. Many Japanese cafes, restaurants, and hotels introduce our blends to their menus to add excitement. Our blends are also often used as a base for creative mocktails, like the Garden of Eden-based mocktail our CEO sampled at a restaurant. ",
          "While in Japan, our team had the privilege of seeing the legendary seasonal blooming of the Sakura, or Japanese cherry blossom. Each year, the cherry blossom trees around Japan bloom, covering the landscape in magnificent blossoms. The Peninsula Hotel in Tokyo wanted to celebrate this seasonal event, so we created a tea that perfectly captured the aromas of the Sakura bloom.",
          'In Japan, "afternoon" tea is a bit of a misnomer. Afternoon tea is massively popular and service runs up to 9 pm at night. Like American tea service, Japanese afternoon tea includes tiers of treats and pots of tea. We had the opportunity to visit an afternoon tea at the Ritz Carlton Osaka, too, and were blown away by the luxurious tea service. ',

        text: [
          "You've probably heard about some health benefits of drinking tea. From magazine articles to news segments, tea is often celebrated as a healthy alternative to soda or other sugary beverages. The one benefit that's rarely discussed isn't related to health, though. It's the benefit to your mental well-being. To reap the full benefits of tea, you'll need to look beyond just consuming the warm liquid in your cup. You'll need to consume a tea-drinking experience. ",
          "The practice of steeping and drinking tea can almost be spiritual. Historically, tea is often tied to ceremonies and traditions. Silver Needle is said to have been picked by virgins and served to emperors. Matcha was once enjoyed by the wealthy in ceremonial settings. These ceremonies might seem archaic or stuffy now, but the principle can be applied to modern tea drinking.",
          "To bring the serenity of the tea-drinking ceremony into your life, think about how you usually digest food and drink. Do you eat quickly while you scroll through your Newsfeed? Do you slurp down your tea while you shoot out an email? Is consumption a sped-up, out-of-focus action that accompanies the hustle and bustle of your life? Or is it a sacred time for you?",
          "Making time to drink tea is easy. First, put more intention into your tea brewing process. If you usually start multitasking while your tea steeps, stop. Instead, carefully select your tea, pour in water that's the appropriate temperature, and steep for the right amount of time. Take this moment for yourself. You can even make a point of using this time as a detox from screens and technology.",
          "You'll also want to make sure you have the right environment to drink tea. Whether that means cozying up on your favorite chair or making your office workspace more hospitable, you want to make your experience as pleasant and relaxing as possible. Set yourself up to fully experience your tea from the first sip until the last sip.",
          "As you start to drink your tea, try to focus on what you're sensing. 80% of what you're experiencing when you drink tea is through your sense of smell. When you remove your tea leaves from your cup or teapot, smell them and try to figure out what the tea reminds you of. As you actually sip the tea, let it pass over each part of your tongue so you can taste each flavor note. Different sections of the tongue sense different tastes, so it's important that you expose as much area of the tongue to the tea as you can.",
          "By creating a moment for yourself every time you drink tea, you'll increase your own mindfulness and you'll find that your tea drinking can provide an experience that goes beyond taste and smell.",

At that time, tea was a drink of luxury for the privileged class, as well as for monks. When Confucianism replaced Buddhism in the 14th century, tea drinking all but ended. It wasn’t until the 1990s that tea production was commercialized on a large scale. There are three growing areas in Korea: Boseong, Hadong, and Jeju-do.

Nepalese teas are often compared to, or wrongly sold as Darjeeling Teas of India, due to their similar look and flavor. In 1864, the Emperor of China gave the Prime Minister of Nepal, Junga Bahadur Rana, many gifts on his visit to China, including precious tea seeds. During this time, however, Nepal was run by a centralized autocracy known as the Rang Dynasty which isolated it from the outside world, and tea production was minimal. In the last 1950s, a new democracy was formed which opened Nepal’s borders and tea production began on a much larger scale. In 1982, five districts were recognized as producing Nepalese teas: Jhapa, Ilam, Panchthar, Dhankuta, and Terhathum. Nepal produces mostly black tea, in both orthodox and CTC manufacture, though, there are some unique oolong and green teas being produced by small-batch holders.",

Georgia, then under Russian control, became the main supplier of tea to the Soviets. The quality of tea declined as the Soviets demanded more and more tea be produced, resulting in the use of mechanical harvesting and production. With Georgia’s independence, tea went back to being produced in the old fashion way, by hand. Today, the skills and knowledge of hand production are being passed on to the next generation who are sharing their black teas with the world.",

Vietnam can trace its tea production back 3,000 years when wild tea trees flourished. In the 1820s, the French started the first commercial production of tea in the country. After the Vietnam War, many foreign investors helped rebuild and grow tea production. Today, tea is grown in 37 provinces throughout Vietnam. Vietnam makes CTC black and green teas and orthodox black, green (steamed and pan-fired), oolong, dark, and jasmine teas. Lotus tea is the prized tea of Vietnam and is hard to find outside their borders. Traditionally, tea is enclosed in the blossoms of the lotus flower overnight where the tea naturally absorbs the sweet floral perfume of the lotus blossom.",

          "What is tea? Well, even though there are many different types of tea  — white, green, oolong, pu-erh, black, etc. — they all come from the same plant called Camellia sinensis.",
          "And while each tea has a distinct flavor and body, white tea is lighter with some notes of honey and a rich, grassy taste.",
          "But what else makes white tea so unique and delicious?",
          "For tea to be considered a white tea it has to come from a region in China called Fujian. Originally, it got its name from the silvery-white color it gets from the tiny hair of the unopened tea buds.",
          "The reason the buds aren’t open is due to the process of picking the young leaves and buds that haven’t bloomed yet. In fact, these young buds are picked only 7 to 10 days out of the entire year and undergo no processing before being dried — it’s these younger leaves that actually give white tea its delicate flavor.",
          "White tea is broken into three major grades. The two best types are Baihao Yinzhen and Bai Mu Dan and the lowest grade is Shou Mei (which we won’t discuss in this article).",
          "Also known as Silver Needle tea, this type of tea is the highest grade of white tea available. And its name is extremely fitting: it’s made up of unopened buds that are shaped like a bunch of needles.",
          "The reason that this type is the best is due to its Hao content. Hao is the soft down covering on the outside of the tea that comes off into the tea as you steep it; these little hairs rest at the top of your cup of tea and reflect the light, giving it a shimmer or silver color.",
          "Hao has a very high antioxidant content and also gives the tea a very smooth consistency. There’s also a legend that says it was grown in a secret garden within the province of Fujian and hand-picked by virgins with white gloves; the story goes that only the emperor could drink it.",
          "Although this tea has a slightly lower grade than the Baihao Yinzhen, it’s still delicious and adored by many. (It goes by the name “White peony” in English.) This type of tea has a mix of both the young leaves and buds.",
          "Both of these teas can be blended and flavored. The Bai Hao Yinzhen has an especially mild flavor. (Some would go so far as to say that it is almost tasteless.) At Art of Tea, we offer blends of both. Tuscany is a blended Baihao Yinzhen that has the flavors of rose and lavender. There's also a blended Bai Mu Dan called Butterscotch, which is a sweet delicious buttery tea so tasty and fulfilling that it can replace even your favorite dessert.",
          "Ultimately, white tea is a wonderfully delicate and light tea with high antioxidant levels making it a fantastic choice for your health. And if that weren't enough, they offer a unique blend of delicious flavors that are lighter than your typical tea. Enjoy!",

Here at Art of Tea, our tea masters have created this guide to highlight the differences between these two types of Chinese fermented teas; giving you the knowledge and wisdom you need to enjoy them both to the fullest. To begin, it’s best to start with a brief description of what pu-erh teas actually are and where they came from:",
          "Pu-erh teas were originally cultivated in the province of Yunnan in southern China. Yunnan has been home to wild tea trees for hundreds of years and pressed tea cakes were exported from Yunnan to Tibet as early as the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Pu-erh tea is a post-fermented tea, which means that the tea leaves go through a microbial fermentation process after they have been dried and rolled, causing the leaves to darken and change in flavor. This process allows the teas to not only improve with age like wine or cheese, but many pu-erhs are able to retain their freshness for up to five decades. Pu-erh teas can be found in compressed brick form or in loose leaf form and can be made from both green and black tea leaves. Pu-erh tea is made from a larger leaf strain of Camellia Sinensis called Dayeh, which are ancient trees with mature leaves that are said to be between 500 and 1000 years old. These trees are usually grown in temperate regions and although they can be harvested year-round, the best time to harvest is in mid-spring. Various conditions and environmental factors can impact the flavor profile of pu-erh, resulting in a rich experience for the tea drinker’s palate. Pu-erh can be smooth, fruity, peaty, grassy, musky, herbal, and earthy.",
          "Sheng pu-erhs – or raw pu-erhs – are pu-erhs that are naturally fermented over a long aging period. Sheng pu-erhs are typically pressed into discs and are aged for at least 10 years before they are considered “drinkable” by tea masters. Well-aged sheng pu-erhs are generally favored by tea connoisseurs for their complex and subtle flavors, but the time required for proper ripening means they are the most expensive type of pu-erh teas. Ripened sheng pu-erhs as we know them today – pu-erhs aged and brewed without additives – were popularized in Hong Kong by immigrant populations after the Chinese civil war.",
          "During the 1970s, when the demand for pu-erh teas began to skyrocket and outpace the supply of aged sheng pu-erh available, tea makers were forced to come up with a solution. Master tea makers developed a technique to accelerate the fermentation process and imitate the unique flavor of sheng pu-erhs – this technique came to be known as shou pu-erh, or “cooked” pu-erh. To make shou pu-erh, the green maocha (tea that has undergone processing but not ready for retail sale yet) is heaped into a large pile. Tea makers often mix in a small amount of a previous batch of fermented tea to introduce desirable microbes, and then the leaves are left to ferment. This process works similarly to composting, with the dense tea leaf pile producing heat that encourages accelerated fermentation. The leaves are then turned regularly until they are fully fermented, at which point they may be pressed into cakes and are ready to drink.",
          "In China, pu-erh tea has long been consumed to achieve a wide variety of health benefits, such as improvements in heart health and reductions in cholesterol levels. It’s also said that pu-erh tea can help promote weight loss, enhance eyesight, stimulate circulation, and soothe hangovers. Pu-erh tea may also fight oxidative stress, regulate blood sugar levels (a key factor in diabetes control), protect against obesity, and possess anti-cancer activity. Pu-erh tea is said to contain lower levels of caffeine than other types of tea.",

          "COLD BREWING ICED TEA",
          "Cold brewing tea may take a bit longer than other iced tea brewing methods, but this time allows for increased strength and flavor. With Cold brew iced tea, the slower brewing process creates a sweeter brew that is more delicate and nuanced due to fewer tannins in the brew. There is very little bitterness and astringency in this process, but rather a strong, bold finish. To cold brew tea, add one 2 quart iced tea pouch or 7 teaspoons of loose leaf tea to the Takeya pitcher. Flash steep in 1 cup of hot water for 2 minutes. Fill the pitcher with 7 cups of freshly drawn cold water, then cover and refrigerate for 8-10 hours. Remove sachet or loose leaf tea, pour into glasses, serve over ice, and enjoy! Try cold brewing your favorite fruit forward teas, such as Meyer Lemon Iced Tea, for a truly bright and refreshing summer sip!",
          "FLASH CHILL BREWING",
          "The flash chill method is also a great option when you want your iced tea now! According to a study published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology, there is evidence to suggest that cold infusing your tea preserves the beneficial molecules (antioxidants and others) in the tea leaf, protecting them from degradation. Add one 2 quart sachet or 5-7 teaspoons of loose leaf tea into the pitcher. Heat 2.75 cups of water to the desired temperature (depending on tea type), and add it to the pitcher. Steep for 3-5 minutes, then remove sachet or loose leaf tea. Fill the entire pitcher with ice, seal shut, and shake for 30 seconds to flash chill iced tea!",

        text: [
          "Whether you’re new to Art of Tea, or you’re a seasoned tea fanatic, you might be wondering if there’s much of a difference between your run-of-the-mill store bought tea bags, and high quality loose leaf tea. At Art of Tea, we know there’s a world of difference, and it doesn’t take a connoisseur to tell them apart. Expand your tea horizons with a new aromatic, hand-blended tea every month as a member of our Tea Club, and taste these 5 reasons we choose high quality tea every time.",
          "1) FLAVOR PROFILE AND AROMA",
          "Every type of tea, from black tea to rooibos, has a distinct and unique flavor profile with different tasting notes. Because high quality teas are typically processed by hand, and made from select ingredients, the smell and taste of the resulting brew are strong, complex, and unaltered by any manufacturing processes.",
          "2) HIGHER TEA GRADE",
          "When tea is manufactured, it is passed through a series of progressively finer sieves in a process known as tea grading. Most tea that you find at the grocery store is low grade, meaning that it is composed of the finest leaf shavings and dust that remain at the end of grading, mixed together with broken leaves. High grade quality loose leaf teas are made from whole, unbroken tea leaves for full bodied flavor. At The Teath Avenue, we source only from the top 2% of all teas produced in the world. Quality is something that we wholeheartedly refuse to compromise on, and we take great pride in the teas that we are able to offer you, our communiTEA.",
          "3) MAXIMIZE HEALING",
          "Low grade teas can be contaminated by tea bag additives like trace amounts of bleach and microplastics, and lack the antioxidant and health benefits of pure high grade teas. Different types of teas are associated with helping address various health concerns, and may improve immunity, assist in weight loss, prevent cardiovascular disease, and so on.",
          "4) BETTER VALUE",
          "Low grade tea may be cheaper than quality tea, but it is so many steps below when it comes to taste, flavor, and health benefits, that it is not worth the savings. Sometimes, lower grade bagged tea will actually cost you more in the long run than a tin of loose leaf, which yields more cups and can actually be reinfused and steeped more than once!",
          "5) A MEANINGFUL RITUAL",
          "At The Teath Avenue, we deeply respect the ritual aspect of tea. Preparing a pot or a cup is a momentary meditation, a mindfulness practice, nestled into your day’s activities. There is no doubt that this ritual means so much more when it involves the inspiring aromas and stimulating flavor of high quality tea.",

        title: "What is Ayurveda?",
        text: [
          "Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine that has been practiced in India for over 5000 years. The name Ayurveda translates to “The Science of Life,” and focuses on achieving optimal health through a balance of mind, body, and consciousness.",
          "The Ayurveda principles, which are based on achieving a balanced state of mind, are an important step in achieving a healthy body. The Yoga Sutras and the Vedas understood the connection between the purity of one’s mind through the constant and regular practice of Yoga, thereby applying the principles Niyamas and Yamas to achieve total health of the mind, body, and spirit.",
          "The Niyamas contains ten traditional principles:",
          "Giving without expecting in return, contentment, faith, modesty, developing a spiritual will, repetition or chanting of mantras, worship, scriptural listening and learning, fulfillment of faithful observance, a focused effort on body purification and spiritual enlightenment.",
          "The Yamas, on the other hand, are goals and rules which also have ten traditional principles:",
          "Compassion, honesty, purity, truthfulness, non-violence, not stealing, divine conducts, overcoming non-perseverance, having a moderate appetite, patience",
          "These are principles that help guide a person to achieve total mental, spiritual, and physical health. Taking the utmost care of our bodies and forging a healthy relationship with fellowmen are some of Ayurveda’s most important teachings. Ayurveda experts carefully assess a person’s life before recommending treatment, including diet, sleep, relationship aspects, and exercise. After looking closely at these details, the patient’s health emerges.",
          "According to the ancient Vedic Texts called The Charaka Samhita, a healthy mind is a key to obtaining optimum health. If we have a positive and good outlook about other people and ourselves, then spiritual and physical health follows. The purification of the mind and body creates harmony in the universe, ourselves and those around us. If we have healthier minds and bodies, we exude confidence and balance and we are able to have close relationships with other people.",
          "Living a peaceful life is Ayurveda’s goal. The balance between the mind and body is necessary to achieve its optimal state. Constant and regular application of the Yoga principles mentioned above helps create harmony in the mind, body, and spirit. You will be able to enjoy the best of everything life has to give.",

        title: "Caffeine Content of Tea",
        text: [
          "You may not know that dry tea has more caffeine by weight than coffee. However, since more dried coffee is used than dry tea per cup, a cup of steeped tea contains significantly less caffeine than a cup of coffee of the same size.",
          "Most studies show that tea has between 40 and 120mg caffeine per eight-ounce serving; whereas coffee has about 80-206mg caffeine per eight-ounce serving. So even at the highest caffeine levels, tea has only half the caffeine content of a cup of coffee.",
          "Additionally, caffeine levels are directly related to how long tea is steeped. The longer a tea steeps, the higher the caffeine content.",
          "Another fact to consider is that caffeine in tea is different from that found in coffee. Unlike coffee, tea leaves contain an amino acid called theanine, which works synergistically with caffeine to create a more balanced stimulative effect in the body. What this means is that rather than feeling a surge of energy than a sudden crash shortly after, as you sometimes do with coffee or other caffeinated beverages, you may feel a more gradual and revitalizing rise in energy that eventually balances itself out into a calmer, clearer and more focused state.",

          "Proper tea storage helps to preserve the flavor and freshness of your tea long after production. While tea does not spoil, as with any consumable product, the sooner it is enjoyed the fresher and more potent it will be. Stored properly, unflavored teas can last up to 18 months. Flavored teas can last up to six months.",
          "The Teath Avenue recommends storing your tea in airtight containers to ensure longevity and keeping these containers away from heat, moisture and exposure to light. Teas are fragile and can be easily altered by neighboring spices and aromas, so be sure to store them in an area where the leaves cannot be permeated. ",
          "WATER QUALITY",
          "Always start with fresh cold water. Spring water or filtered water is recommended. Low mineral bottled water or distilled water can be used if water in your area is hard. It is best to avoid reheating the same batch of water. This will allow more control of the temperature and a more enhanced tasting experience when steeping your tea.",

        title: "What is Black Tea?",
        text: [
          "Black tea, also known as “red tea” in China for its rich, reddish infusion, is unique in that it is comprised of two different forms of the camellia sinensis plant: camellia sinensis sinensis and camellia sinensis assamica. Camellia Sinensis Sinensis yields shorter leaves and is primarily used in China and other neighboring East Asian countries. Camellia Sinensis Assamica has larger leaves and is used in parts of India and Sri Lanka. Dry black tea leaves are 100% oxidized, leaving them with a blackened color, thus earning its namesake. While the method in which it is produced varies from region to region, the process always involves withering, rolling, oxidization, and drying. There are two primary methods of processing the leaves before they are graded:",
          "Orthodox Method – This is the most common method of processing black teas. With this method, more care is put into the tea leaves. After the leaves are picked, they are allowed to wither in the warm air for up to 18 hours to reduce their water content until they are soft and pliable. The leaves are then rolled in a special machine that gently presses and twists the leaves in order to break the cells to begin the oxidization process. This process can take several rounds, depending on the grade of a leaf is cut. After the leaves are cut, they are once again exposed to the air in a climate-controlled environment so that they can continue to oxidize, altering the level of polyphenols in the leaf. This is the point where the flavor of the leaf begins to develop. Once the leaves reach the appropriate oxidization level, they are then fed into a machine to dry, which halts the oxidization process.",
          "CTC (Cut, Tear, Curl) Method – This method was developed around the teabag boom of the 1950s to facilitate the production of smaller cut tea leaves and quicker processing time. While the production begins and ends in the same fashion with withering and drying, the rolling process is skipped in this method and the leaves are instead minced and broken apart in a rotor vane machine.",
          "HISTORY OF BLACK TEA",
          "Until the mid 17th century (Late Ming, Early Qing Dynasty), the only teas consumed in China were green (unoxidized) and oolong (semi-oxidized) teas.",
          "The tale goes that while a passing army entered the Fujian province, they decided to take shelter at a nearby tea factory. This held up production at the tea factory, where leaves were left out in the sun, causing them to oxidize for a longer period of time and resulting in darker leaves. In an effort to accelerate the drying time, they decided to smoke the leaves over pinewood, thus creating Lapsang Souchong, which became one of the very first black teas.",
          "Although compressed, post-fermented teas (pu-erh) were already known as “black teas” in China, the term was usurped by Dutch and British traders who began identifying Chinese “red teas” as “black teas” because of the color of the dark, dry leaves. Even to this day, Chinese “red tea” is still referred to as “black tea” in the Western world.",
          "What impressed the Westerners most about black tea was not only the robust flavor the tea produced but also the improved lifespan of the leaves over time. And, as British demand for black tea grew, so did the holes in their pockets as they struggled to pay for their tea treasures in a market that was quickly being monopolized by the Dutch. This motivated British traders to explore other avenues for acquiring black tea. After several failed attempts, they discovered a similar genus of the camellia sinensis plant (camellia sinensis assamica) that could be cultivated by machine in India, yielding a bolder crop at a more lucrative return, thus catapulting the Western tea industry to a new level and reshaping our perception of the importance of black tea today.",
          "BLACK TEA TODAY",
          "In today’s market, “broken leaf” black tea accounts for over 90% of all tea sold in the US, the majority of which is enjoyed as iced tea. Also, with the invention of the teabag at the turn of the 20th century, black tea quickly became a household staple and continues to be a popular favorite in the home today. So much so that it’s almost a wonder to the Western world that black tea was ever enjoyed outside of a paper bag with a string attached to it!",
          "Nowadays, with the resurgence of the Chinese economy and the growing wealth of tea knowledge surrounding us, we are once again introducing our palates to the many wonders of black tea and the many dynamic taste profiles it offers. The major production of black tea today stems from India, China, Sri Lanka, and Africa.",
          "BLACK TEA TYPES & VARIANTS",
          "Usually, high-quality black tea is kept within the country of origin and very rarely gets exported. However, Art of Tea has cultivated unique relationships with fair trade organic black tea estates and growers, therefore allowing us an exclusive opportunity to share those teas with you. Depending on the aroma, flavor, body, elevation, and time of harvest, Art of Tea offers a wonderful variety of black teas ranging from single-origin to blended infusions. Here is a breakdown of some of our favorite black tea types and variants:",
          "CHINESE BLACK TEAS",
          "Congu – Slightly sweet in flavor, this brisk yet rich tea is the perfect starter component for creating kombucha tea.",
          "Keemum Mao Fang – This historically revered tea has been passed down from generation to generation and is still prized for its aromatic properties today. This magnificent tea yields a vibrant cup with notes of pine, cocoa, and marshmallow.",
          "Lapsang Souchong – Considered one of the very first black teas to be introduced to the west, this tea became known for its signature smoky flavor and aroma permeated by the campfires of traveling caravans. Nowadays, the signature flavor is recreated by smoking the leaves over pine needles. This tea pairs nicely with savory dishes.",
          "INDIAN BLACK TEAS",
          "Assam – Usually bold and malty in flavor, this tea has a dramatic character that rivals the potent punch of coffee, making it a great transition tea. This is also a great base for blending and holds up well against multiple steepings.",
          "Darjeeling – Just like champagne, Darjeeling comes from the Darjeeling region of India and has a smooth, bright flavor with muscatel overtones and a slightly floral finish. Arguably one of the best black teas in the world, this dynamic tea leaves behind a subtle hint of lingering astringency on the palate.",
          "SRI LANKAN BLACK TEAS",
          "Ceylon – Depending on the altitude in which it is harvested, this tea may yield a beautiful light golden color with a round, feathery finish or it can be fuller-bodied, with a deep mahogany tincture and bolder taste. Ceylon tea is considered one of the finest in the world.",
          "BLACK TEA TIPS & PREPARATION",
          "Black tea is best prepared at a water temperature of 206° F, with a steep time of about 3-5 minutes, to get the maximum amount of flavor from the leaf. Unlike most other tea types, black teas fare well when steeped with extremely hot water. The only exception to this rule is with Darjeelings, which are more delicate and should be steeped at a lower temperature of 180°F for no longer than 3 minutes to avoid bitterness. Black teas can be re-steeped multiple times although the flavor will depreciate with each steeping. For optimum results, it is suggested that you use about 1 tsp per 8oz cup.",
          "CAFFEINE CONTENT",
          "Because of the oxidization process that goes into the production of black teas, the caffeine levels present in the leaves tend to depreciate. Compared to other tea types, Chinese black teas have about the same caffeine content as green teas, whereas larger leafed Indian black teas have slightly higher caffeine content. Both types are significantly less than that in a cup of coffee, containing about half the amount of caffeine altogether.",
          "The actual caffeine content present in a cup of black tea varies upon how long the tea is steeped. The longer the steep time, the more caffeine the tea will contain. The caffeine content will lessen each time tea is re-steeped.",

        title: "What is Green Tea?",
        text: [
          "Green tea, also known as unoxidized tea, is made solely from the leaves of the camellia sinensis plant. The leaves are plucked, slightly withered, then immediately cooked to preserve the green quality and prevent oxidization. As a result of these methods, green teas have a much higher concentration of chlorophyll, polyphenols, and antioxidants than other tea types. The growing conditions for green tea can be broken down between two different types: sun-grown and shade-grown. The leaves are generally harvested three times a year with the first flush producing the highest quality leaves. The heating process differs greatly depending on the region and the tea maker’s techniques.",
          "Some of the mainstream methods of manufacturing green tea include:",
          "Pan Firing - Chinese green teas are often pan or wok roasted to neutralize the natural enzymes then dried, which generally results in a pale green color such as our Dragonwell. Steaming – In general, most Japanese green teas are quickly deep steamed resulting in a bright green infusion.",
          "HISTORY OF GREEN TEA",
          "Although written records trace the cultivation of green tea as far back as the Han Dynasty (206-220), when its primary use was medicinal, it wasn’t until China’s early Tang Dynasty (600-900) that we hear of green tea being consumed for pleasure. During this time, green tea was only distributed in compressed cakes for easy transport.",
          "During the Tang Dynasty, there was a groundbreaking book written about the art of green tea drinking called the “The Classic of Tea” or “Cha Jing” by Lu Yu. It is considered one of the most important books of its time because it was one of the first all-inclusive explorations of green tea culture as a whole. It was also during this time that the formal tea ceremony came into being; a ritual, in part due to the tools necessary for preparation, accessible only to the wealthy elite. Because of this, green tea consumption became a symbol of status in society.",
          "GREEN TEA TODAY",
          "While green tea has been consumed longer than any other variant of the camellia sinensis plant, the ways in which it is processed haven’t really changed. In many tea producing countries, green teas are still hand-harvested and hand-shaped, and in some cases with the help of very simple age-old machinery that has been passed down from generation to generation. The ways in which it is consumed, however, have changed drastically.",
          "It wasn’t until the late 19th century that green tea made its way into European and more western cultures. Until the invention of the clipper ship, western cultures were only familiar with black teas, which were the result of freshly harvested green teas that were usually transported via camelback for months at a time by traveling merchants.",
          "These merchants would set up camp night after night, exposing the tea to their nearby campfires, therefore permeating the leaves and giving them a more charred appearance and taste. With the invention of the clipper ships, teas could be transported in less than half the time, allowing them to arrive in a more preserved and unprocessed state. This new method of transport revolutionized the way tea, and green tea, in particular, were perceived and experienced forever. Today, green tea can be found everywhere in the mainstream marketplace in forms from loose leaf to powdered (known as matcha), and in other consumables, such as baked goods and breath fresheners.",
          "GREEN TEA TYPES & VARIANTS",
          "Because green tea is grown and harvested in many different regions of China and Japan, it would easily fill up a book trying to explain each type and variant. Listed below are some of the more popular variants of green tea, most of which you can find right here",
          "CHINESE GREEN TEAS",
          "Longjing or Dragonwell is pan-fried and has flat sword-shaped leaves. It has a vibrant jade green hue and a fresh, clean and mellow flavor and aroma.",
          "Gunpowder gets its distinctive name because of the process in which it is made. The leaves are hand-shaped into small spheres that resemble gunpowder and with its slightly brisk and smoky flavor, it really is quite a fitting name. As the primary ingredient in Moroccan Mint tea, gunpowder helps to round out the flavor by balancing out the sharpness of the mint.",
          "Yun Wu or Cloud & Mist is harvested at a much higher altitude, smothered in clouds. The resulting cup has a light and slightly sweet taste.",
          "JAPANESE GREEN TEAS",
          "Gyokuro, or Jade Dew tea, is the most precious and highly sought after green tea. Select Tencha leaves are shade-grown for up to 20 days then harvested and promptly steamed to maintain elevated levels of chlorophyll. The resulting cup steeps a bright green color with a sweet, grassy finish.",
          "Sencha is the most common green tea from Japan and is also the base for many of our green tea fusions. Unlike Gyokuro, Sencha leaves are directly exposed to sunlight. Sencha gets its name from the decoction method in which it is processed and delivers a slightly astringent, vegetal cup with bright grassy after notes.",
          "Kukicha, or twig tea, is comprised of twigs, stems, and stalks. Usually, this tea consists of the remnants of the gyokuro and sencha harvest. This tea is slightly roasted and is a bit more oxidized than most green teas, giving the tea a nutty taste with a round, thick flavor.",
          "Matcha is a finely ground tea powder made from Tencha leaves. It is prepared by whisking the tea powder with hot water in a ceramic bowl. Matcha is the primary form of tea used in traditional Japanese tea ceremonies. The sweet flavor of matcha is due to the number of amino acids present in the tea and the higher the quality, the sweeter and deeper the flavor is.",
          "Tencha is a shade cultivated tea and is harvested primarily for matcha production. The leaves are laid flat to dry instead of rolled like most other tea leaves and are dried completely away from sunlight or indoors. This helps to preserve its darker green color which aids in the production of amino acids.",
          "Genmaicha, popularly known as “popcorn tea” is made with green tea and roasted brown rice. Sometimes referred to as the “people’s tea,” Japanese lore tells of farmers adding rice to stretch out precious tea supplies in order to keep the price down. There are also tales of genmaicha being born out of WWII tea rationing. This tea has a slightly golden hue and has a crisp yet roasted finish.",
          "Hojicha is unique in that it is not steamed like most Japanese teas but is actually roasted over charcoal. This process gives the leaves a brownish appearance, resembling a black tea. This tea steeps a reddish-brown liquor with hints of caramel and a slightly toasted finish.",
          "GREEN TEA TIPS & PREPARATION",
          "Green tea is best prepared at a mild water temperature of 180°-185° F, with a steep time of about 3 minutes. Water that is too hot may result in the release of tannins from the leaves, causing the tea to become astringent. Higher quality green teas can be re-steeped 2-3 times before the flavor begins to degrade. It is suggested that you use about 1 tsp per 8oz cup for optimum results.",
          "CAFFEINE CONTENT",
          "Generally, an 8oz cup of green tea yields about 15-48mg of caffeine per serving. This measurement varies depending on how long the tea is steeped. The longer the steep time, the higher the caffeine content will be. The caffeine content will lessen each time tea is re-steeped.",

        title: "What is White Tea?",
        text: [
          "White tea is comprised of new, young tea leaves and buds from the camellia sinensis plant and is only harvested for a few weeks each spring in the northern district of Fujian, China. The leaves are generally picked in mid-March to early April and only on days when it is not rainy or humid. Just like champagne, white tea can only be called “white tea” if it comes from the Fujian province. White tea gets its name from a silvery type down that covers the leaves and unopened buds, known as “Hao.”",
          "HISTORY OF WHITE TEA",
          "For many years it was believed that white tea was discovered during the Song Dynasty (920-1269), however, even earlier references to white tea have been traced as far back as the Tang Dynasty (618-907). At that time in history, white tea preparation was a very different experience than it is today: early harvest white tea leaves appeared solely in compressed cakes and broken pieces were steeped in earthenware kettles.",
          "Although white tea was popularized and widely revered in the Song Dynasty (960-1269), it was relatively unknown to the rest of the world until very recently. Only royals were allowed to consume white tea and it is rumored that it could only be served as a “tribute” to the emperor by virgins with white gloves as a symbol of honor and respect. One emperor, Hui Zong, became so enamored by white tea that it literally cost him most of his empire. During this time, ceremonial methods of preparing white tea were very similar to the traditional Japanese tea ceremony for matcha; typically in powder form and whisked in wide ceramic bowls.",
          "It wasn’t until the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), that the Ming court ruled that only loose leaf white tea could be served as a tribute to the emperor, thus changing our understanding of white tea processing and its preparation forever.",
          "WHITE TEA TODAY",
          "Modern-day harvesting and preparation of white tea is quite minimal and includes drying and withering of the leaves in one of several methods. These methods include heated vents, wind drying chambers or natural sunlight almost immediately after picking, preventing oxidization. Because of the minimalistic processing involved, many people refer to white tea as a “raw” tea and it is believed to have a higher amount of beneficial properties than green or black teas. The tea withering processes vary from region to region in Fujian and are very much influenced by the environment, both in terms of climate and local traditions.",
          "WHITE TEA TYPES & VARIANTS",
          "White teas can be classified into five different types: Yin Zhen Bai Hao (Silver Needle), Bai Mu Dan (White Peony), Gongmei (Tribute Eyebrow), Shou Mei (Noble, Long Life Eyebrow) and Fujian New Craft (DaBaiCha or DaHoaCha).",
          "Of the five, Silver Needle and White Peony are the most superior in quality and are the only white tea types carried here at Art of Tea. Our prized white teas are hand-picked under strict standards passed down from the Qing Dynasty (1796) and deliver fresh, mellow and sweet golden infusions, completely devoid of astringency.",
          "Of course, we believe that every varietal has something unique to offer, and we encourage you to experiment and find your own favorites; whether it’s a single source of white tea like one of the teas mentioned here or one of our signature white tea blends.",
          "A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE FIVE VARIETALS:",
          "Silver Needle is a premium quality tea and the most sought after white tea. The shape should be uniform with no stems or leaves and should have long, needle-like silvery tips. This tea has a pale golden flush with a sweet floral aroma and a light woodsy body.",
          "White Peony is also a premium quality tea. It consists of two leaves and a silvery bud and has a richer, yet shimmery golden color and texture. It has a sweet, yet nutty taste with a slightly roasted finish. Because white peony lingers longer on the palate, it is an excellent white tea to blend with.",
          "Noble, Long Life Eyebrow is a good quality white tea, though of lesser standing than Silver Needle and White Peony. It is generally comprised of all of the leftover leaves deemed unsuitable to be harvested as Silver Needle or White Peony. Because it is slightly more oxidized, due to being harvested later in the season, it has a darker color and bolder flavor likened to an oolong.",
          "Tribute Eyebrow is another good quality white tea, though of lesser standing than Silver Needle and White Peony. It consists of young leaves without buds and the taste is darker and fuller, with a bold finish.",
          "Fujian New Craft is one of the newest members of the white tea family, with harvesting only occurring as soon as the late 1960’s. It was developed to meet the growing demand for white tea in the Chinese market and comes from Fuding County in Fujian province. An interestingly deceptive white tea at best, this tea is processed by withering, slightly rolling and drying the leaves, giving it the appearance of a black tea. The leaves tend to be long and curly with a rich greenish/brownish color, and are far less delicate than most other white teas. The flavor and liquor are probably the most robust of all the aforementioned white teas, yet the fragrance is extremely mild.",
          "WHITE TEA TIPS & PREPARATION",
          "White teas are best prepared with a milder water temperature of 175°-185° F. Water that is too hot can cause the leaves to overcook and become astringent. To capture the best flavor, we recommend steeping white teas for 1-3 minutes only. Although some white teas can be re-steeped, it is not generally recommended, as the second or third steeping may not yield as flavorful or fragrant a cup. It is suggested that you use about 1 Tbsp per 8oz cup for optimum results.",
          "CAFFEINE CONTENT",
          "Traditionally, white tea has been thought to have less caffeine than other tea types. However, some recent studies have pointed to the possibility of white tea having even greater caffeine content than black tea. Regardless of which theory is being ascribed to, because white teas are typically steeped for a shorter amount of time than more processed teas, the caffeine content present in each brew tends to be significantly less, therefore reinforcing the idea that white teas are less caffeinated.",

Research suggests that unplugging from devices, or taking a “digital detox,” can help improve quality of life by helping to reduce stress and anxiety, aid in sleep quality, increase productivity, and encourage feelings of happiness. Taking a break from screen time will help you connect with the world and people around you, and brewing your daily cup of tea is a perfect opportunity to digitally detox. Practicing this habitually, and forming a daily ritual around your tea routine, helps bring control and mindfulness to your day.",
          "We invite you to take eight minutes out of your day to unplug and create a sense of ritual with tea. The number eight is historically known as a number of good fortune, symbolizing unity and infinite prosperity. Just eight minutes of purpose-driven mindfulness can create powerful results like elevating your mood, increasing feelings of alertness, focusing your thoughts, and lowering stress levels.",
          "Why tea? For centuries, people have enjoyed the benefits of tea, including its adaptogen-like qualities to cleanse the body. Research studies indicate that tea contains antioxidants called catechins that may help prevent certain illnesses and polyphenols that have been shown to aid in digestion. Tea also contains theanine which has been shown to reduce the anxiety causing effects of caffeine stimulation, helping you to focus and deepen your senses.",

        text: [
          "The first simple step to implementing sustainability into your tea routine is to utilize reusable teaware rather than single use items. Loose leaf tea creates the least waste, with the use of reusable tea steepers, steeping pots, or biodegradable teabags, brewing a cup of your favorite tea can be waste free! We also recommend the use of an electric kettle, to eliminate the use of gas when boiling water with a gas stove. We offers a large collection of teaware including the Kinto Glass Teapot, reusable tea Filter Bags, reusable travel Tumbler Cup, and Stagg Electric Kettle.",
          "If you are on the go, or don’t have a reusable tea steeper, our Reusable Tea Filter Bags are the most eco friendly single-use option! No adhesives are used in these tea filters, so there's no need to worry about harmful chemicals leeching into your tea. The reusable tea bags are made from completely natural abaca pulp, cellulose and sealing fiber sourced from the Philippines, making them completely biodegradable as well. Additionally, we recommend using a reusable travel mug over a disposable one whenever possible, not only to eliminate waste, but also to keep your tea at the perfect temperature.",
          "Buying tea in recyclable, non-plastic packaging is another great way to reduce waste. By offering our loose leaf teas in recyclable metal tins, and pyramid bag sachets in 100% recyclable cardboard boxes, Art of Tea products have been certified as carbon neutral. Our adorable retail tins are also perfect for reuse as kitchenware containers or for arts and crafts. Try to avoid purchasing teas that come in fully-plastic packaging, or teabags that are not labeled biodegradable.",
          "Did you know that steeped teabags, like Art of Tea’s biodegradable filter bags and teabag sachets, can be used to help hydrate, fertilize, and feed your plants? Steeped tea bags and loose tea leaves are rich in nutrients that can supercharge your compost bin or garden. As the tea leaves and bag begin to break down and decompose, they release nutrients into the soil that helps plants retain water and thrive. However, you should use tea only on plants that grow best in acidic soil. Tea lowers the soil’s pH and increases its acidity, so only plants that thrive in slightly acidic soil will do well with the addition of tea. Placing biodegradable teabags directly on your compost pile can help break down other items, allowing you to use your compost sooner. You must ensure that your teabags don’t contain any harmful microplastics in order for this to work, so we recommend always being mindful and reading labels. Additionally, teabags are known to keep pests from damaging and destroying plants, and inhibit the growth of weeds; using steeped teabags as a DIY pest repellent is both a cost-effective and natural alternative to sprays that you might find at the market. Composting your used tea bags is a “green” way to dispose of them, with the added benefit of enriching your compost and speeding up the decomposition process.",
          "Many industrial tea companies use heavy machinery when harvesting tea and destroy the surrounding land in the process. At The teath Avenue, we source from the top 2% of teas produced in the world. Our mission is to create a delicious experience by providing the highest quality product we can. We use organic and natural ingredients whenever possible, and are committed to sustainable business practices. We thank you for your support.",

While we can’t begin to know everything about tea, we hope that we can help guide you with our extensive knowledge of what we do know about tea in this section.",
          "Green tea is often consumed for its believed health benefits. The potential metabolism-boosting qualities of green tea come from catechins, a type of antioxidant that triggers the release of fat from fat cells and helps speed the liver's capacity for turning fat into energy, especially when combined with naturally-occurring caffeine. A 12-week study was performed to analyze the influence of green tea on weight loss, in which participants who consumed 4-5 cups of green tea each day, paired with a 25-minute workout, lost an average of 2 more pounds and more belly fat than the non-tea-drinking exercisers. Studies on green tea consumption without the addition of exercise indicate that consuming green tea can help you burn an additional 75–100 calories per day, making it a great choice if you’re looking to boost your metabolism.",
          "To enjoy these health benefits, you should avoid bottled teas with excess added sugar and brew your own green tea instead. Art of Tea carries organic green teas in both loose leaf form and pyramid bag sachets.

          "Oolong tea, a traditional Chinese favorite, has also been found to have metabolism-boosting properties. Like green tea, oolong is also packed with catechins, which may have the ability to improve the body's ability to metabolize fat. Studies show that adding oolong tea to one’s diet may increase the number of calories your body burns by up to 3.4%. Oolong tea is also high in the amino acid L-theanine, which studies show has cognitive effects like better sleep quality and stress reduction, both of which have been shown to improve digestion and metabolism.

White tea is made from the Camellia sinensis plant and its leaves are picked just before they fully open, when they have small, fine white hairs, hence the origin of the “white” tea name. Compared with green and black teas, white tea is the least processed and therefore, retains a high amount of antioxidants which may potentially benefit the body and mind in many ways. Understand the benefits of white tea and introduce a cup or two to your daily routine.",
          "Due to the fact that it is minimally processed, white tea is very rich in antioxidants which have been known to be beneficial for the body. Antioxidants may help fight off free radicals in the body which can cause cell damage.

          "Kombucha is, in simplest terms, some combination of fermented tea, sugar, bacteria, and yeast. To make kombucha, you ferment sweetened green or black tea with a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast, otherwise known as SCOBY. As the tea ferments, the yeast breaks down the sugar, thereby creating probiotic bacteria. This results in a carbonated drink that is slightly sweet, slightly sour, and incredibly trendy. In recent years, people have started using kombucha as a healthful alternative to other sugary drinks on the market. This is largely in part to the many potential health benefits associated with drinking kombucha.",
          "1. Kombucha is rich in probiotics which have been known to boost gut health.",
          "All fermented foods are known to be good sources of probiotics, a combination of “good” live bacteria and yeasts that naturally occur in the body. Probiotics provide your gut with healthy bacteria which may improve digestion, decrease inflammation, boost metabolic functioning, and more. Gut health is linked to overall wellness, so adding kombucha to your diet may be beneficial.",
          "2. Drinking kombucha can help you hydrate and recover after a workout.",
          "When you sweat during a workout, you lose electrolytes, thereby increasing your risk of becoming dehydrated. Because kombucha contains naturally occurring minerals and electrolytes, it is a great post-workout drink that can help your body refuel and repair. Additionally, because kombucha is a form of tea and tea is 98% water, drinking kombucha can help you hit your daily hydration goals.",
          "3. Kombucha has been known to have a high antioxidant concentration.",
          "Because kombucha is made from tea which is naturally high in antioxidants, you can get similar health benefits from consuming kombucha. Research shows that antioxidants may help the body fight off free radicals, which has been linked to improving bodily function and reducing inflammation that is associated with disease, depression, and dull skin.",

That said, caffeine from tea has been known to provide clear and focused energy without the crash, jitters, or negative side effects associated with drinking too much coffee. Additionally, kombucha is a good source of iron and B vitamins that have been linked to helping boost energy and fighting fatigue.",
          "5. Kombucha is an all-natural and delicious alternative to commercially-found sodas.",

Additionally, always check in with a trusted medical professional before incorporating new health supplements into your diet.",

          "Tea can be a wonderful way to enhance your everyday wellness routine. Whether you’re looking to increase your immunity, drink more water, get a better night’s sleep, or look and feel your best, tea may help you reach your goals. Keep reading to learn more about how to incorporate tea into your overall wellness routine now!",
          "Brewing a morning cup of tea is a great way to clear your mind, hydrate your body, and prepare you for the day ahead, making it a great way to increase wellness.",
          "We love starting the day with matcha, a powdered green tea that has been known to have a high antioxidant concentration. Matcha, like our Ceremonial Grade Matcha, is a healthy and delicious alternative to coffee that can provide clean energy without the jitters or any other negative side effects associated with consuming too much coffee. This is because matcha contains high levels of L-theanine which has been known to promote stress relief, so when paired with the naturally occurring caffeine in matcha, it can foster clean and focused energy.",
          "We’ve also found that the process of preparing matcha is a great way to implement a morning routine that may help you start your day off on the right foot. Finally, consuming matcha daily has been known to help promote clear skin, better immunity, and proper digestion, all of which are key components to looking and feeling your best.",
          "For optimal results, we recommend doing your morning tea ritual before looking at your phone or beginning work. Treat this as an important step in your everyday wellness routine whereby you can allow yourself to check in with your body and your mind to feel balanced, refreshed, and ready to take on the day.",
          "Throughout the day, we encourage you to sip on teas that promote gut health and proper digestion. Gut health is so important to our overall well-being, from promoting glowing skin to boosting immunity to absorbing nutrients from the foods we eat, if your gut is out of balance, your overall health and wellness will be too. We recommend our Wellness Gut Health Tea Bundle, made up of our Soothe Tea and Cleanse Tea to promote the body's natural cleansing process and help restore balance in the digestive system.",
          "Tea may help calm you down if you’re feeling tired or overwhelmed by life’s daily stressors. Taking a mid-day break to brew a cup of soothing tea can play a huge role in your everyday wellness routine, allowing you to recharge, refocus, and continue onwards. We love a chamomile blend, like our 6:00 PM Tea that includes lavender and roses, as chamomile has been known to promote relaxation.",
          "Exercise is a key component to overall health and wellness as it may improve your mood, boost your energy levels, promote circulation, increase your immunity, and can keep you physically fit and able.",
          "That said, to fully reap the benefits of your workouts, it is extremely important to properly fuel your body. Teas like our Bright Eyed blend may help promote muscle recovery, increase blood flow to muscles, and potentially offset inflammation. Adding tea to your post-workout routine can be a great way to enhance your everyday wellness routine.",
          "Water is essential to overall health and wellness. Our bodies are made up of about 60% water, and just about every bodily function depends on it to operate properly. When you’re dehydrated, you don’t feel or look your best, as water is essential for healthy skin, hair, and nails, as well as aiding in digestion, controlling heart rate, and regulating blood pressure.",
          "Drinking tea counts towards your water intake, making it a great addition to your everyday wellness routine. At its core, a cup of tea is 98% water and 2% tea, making it a great way to hit your daily water intake goals. Additionally, tea is packed with antioxidants, making it an incredibly healthy (and delicious) alternative to water. Whether it’s green tea, white tea, black tea, oolong tea, or tisanes, all tea has been known to help keep you hydrated, so pick the blend that you like most and make a daily cup of tea a habit.",
          "Herbal teas have been known to help promote a restful night of sleep. Getting adequate sleep is incredibly important to your overall health as it allows your mind and body to rest and repair. Sleep deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of disease and illness, compromised immunity, dull skin, and mental health problems, so you should never compromise on those 8 hours.",
          "A cup of soothing herbal tea, like our Sleep Tea, may help your mind and body transition into a state of relaxation, which can potentially help you fall asleep faster. We always recommend caffeine-free teas for your evening tea ritual in order to ensure that caffeine will not interfere with your sleep schedule. Additionally, look for blends with other calming ingredients, like chamomile, lavender, and lemon balm, to help nurture a better night’s sleep and an enhanced everyday wellness routine.",

          "Tea has been known to have high antioxidant concentration, and research shows that antioxidants may be key to skin health by helping fight off free radicals (introduced to your skin from the environment in the form of pollution, UV rays, and more). Without the presence of antioxidants, these stressors can affect your body in the form of wrinkles, skin discoloration and dullness, and premature aging.",
          "Polyphenols, a type of antioxidant found in several teas, have been known to be anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial. Additionally, research has shown that polyphenols may help combat excess oil production which has been linked to clogged pores and acne. Polyphenols have also been shown to improve gut health, and a healthy gut is thought to be crucial in preventing inflammation that can cause acne, redness, and the breakdown of collagen.",
          "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a type of polyphenol, has been known to fight off free radical damage while potentially adding moisture to your skin and slowing down wrinkle formation. EGCG has benefits when ingested or used topically.",
          "Tannins, another type of polyphenol found in most teas, fight free radical damage as well.",
          "Because green tea contains caffeine, it may potentially shrink blood vessels and decrease puffiness when applied topically. We recommend refrigerating used green tea bags and using them as eye masks for this very purpose if you’ve had a long night or are simply looking for a quick and refreshing boost. Try Sencha Green Tea or Matcha+ Tea eco teabag sachets from our Green Tea Collection for your DIY eye mask to reap the benefits!",
          "Additionally, it is believed that green tea may be able to reduce inflammation in skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and dandruff. To make a soothing tea toner, steep a cup of green tea or black tea, let it cool, and then pour it into a spray bottle or glass bottle with a lid. You can add other ingredients known to promote healthy skin like aloe vera or rose water, or just use it as is. Apply it to your skin after cleansing and see the difference for yourself.",
          "Chamomile tea, like our Egyptian Chamomile Tea, Chamomile Clementine Tea, and Soothe Tea, has been known to possess anti-inflammatory properties when applied topically as well. This makes it a good choice for someone looking to soothe irritated skin, sunburn, puffy eyes, and acne outbreaks. You can make chamomile tea into ice cubes for an all-natural cold compress that may help calm your skin. Just be sure to wrap them in a cloth before applying them to the face to protect your skin from ice burns.",
          "Drinking a cup of tea is an easy, delicious, and cost-effective way to up your hydration, boost your antioxidant intake, and potentially do your skin a huge favor.

          "Kombucha is, in simplest terms, some combination of fermented tea, sugar, bacteria, and yeast, that creates a carbonated probiotic drink. Kombucha has become incredibly popular in recent years, largely in part to the many potential health benefits associated with drinking kombucha. So if you’re thinking about jumping on the kombucha bandwagon, we have great news - you can actually make kombucha at home, using your favorite Art of Tea products! Learn how now.",
          "To make kombucha, you must use a true tea from the Camellia sinensis plant. You can choose between black, oolong, green, and white teas. You can even blend different tea leaves together to create unique flavor profiles, but you cannot use herbal teas or tisanes for your kombucha base. Herbs and botanicals won’t be able to provide the nutrients necessary to feed your kombucha culture, thereby inhibiting the fermentation process. Additionally, avoid strongly flavored teas with natural oils or spices as additives may potentially have a negative effect on the growth of your kombucha culture.",
          "We recommend using organic teas for your base as any pesticides or chemicals can inhibit the fermentation process and harm your symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast, otherwise known as SCOBY. Art of Tea blends use organic and natural ingredients whenever possible, so rest assured that if you’re making kombucha using one of our delicious teas, you’ll get a delicious brew!",
          "We also recommend using pure, filtered water, as water can affect the taste and quality of your final brew. No matter how you’re enjoying your tea (or in this case, kombucha), pure, fresh, and filtered water is a must!",
          "You’ll also need sugar, which will serve as the food for the bacteria and yeast. Sugar is crucial to the fermentation process, as the SCOBY eats most of the sugar in the tea, thereby transforming it into the delicious beverage that we’ve come to love. We recommend organic cane sugar or white sugar, but you can also use raw honey if you’re looking for an alternative sweetener. It should be noted that the longer you ferment the kombucha, the less sugary your final brew will be, so adjust according to your unique tastes and preferences.",
